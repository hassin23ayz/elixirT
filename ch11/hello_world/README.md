# HelloWorld

-An OTP application is a component that consists of multiple modules 
-An OTP application can depend on other Applications 

-create a new project 
$ mix new hello_world --sup 

-sup makes mix tool generate the application callback module and start the empty childless supervisor from it

-start the system 
$ iex -S mix 

-Calling iex -S mix automatically starts theapplication together with its dependencies
-It should be noted that you canâ€™t start multiple instances of a single application. In this sense, an application is like a singleton in a   single BEAM instance

-But Application.stop/1 stops only the specified application, leaving dependencies (other applications) running. To stop the entire system in a controlled way, you can invoke System.stop/0

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
