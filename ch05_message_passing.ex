# The content of the message is an Elixir term â€” anything you can store in a variable.
# Take the first message from the mailbox (FIFO queue)
# Try to match it against any of the provided patterns, going from top to bottom.
# If a pattern matches the message, run the corresponding code.
# If no pattern matches, put the message back into the mailbox at the same position it originally occupied.
# Then try the next message.
# If there are no more messages in the queue, wait for a new one to arrive.
# If the after clause is specified and no message is matched in the given amount of
# time, run the code from the after block.
